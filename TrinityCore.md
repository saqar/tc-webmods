# Introduction #

Trinity is a fork of MaNGOS. It came about due to some development style conflicts with the MaNGOS devs. The Trinity team feels that revision control should be handled in a different way, a stable branch and an unstable (or development branch), plus potentially many others. Another reason for the fork is that we felt that scripting belonged in the core. Yes, folks, that means no more having to build SD2 + MaNGOS :). Lastly, we wanted to have much better DB interaction.

# Details #

Trinity was at one point a merger of mangos with many patches submitted by users, now that is no longer the case, trinity is an individual project sustained by code from mostly our users and developers. Trinity has also been cleaned up a lot, and will continue to be cleaned up and optimized over time, please help us by posting issues, patches and enhancement suggestions into the tracker.
